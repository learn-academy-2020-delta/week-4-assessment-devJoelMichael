# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What is an instance variable in Ruby? How is it different from other variables?

  Your answer: An instance variable is run at the same time as the code is being typed. 

  Researched answer: The main difference is its behavior with inheritance. Class variables are shared between a class and all its subclasses, while class instance variables only belong to tone specific class.



2. What is a block in Ruby?

  Your answer: Ruby block is used in methods. (I honestly totally didn't know) 

  Researched answer: Ruby block may appear only in the source adjacent to a method call. It is written on the same line as the method calls last parameter (the closing parentheses of the list). The code in the block is not executed at the same time it is encountered.



3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: I think it might be something with the setter and getter or methods?

  Researched answer: It returns the value of the last evaluated expressions. getter is the most commonly used.



4. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.

  Researched answer: The most common/popular ones are class-based, meaning that the objects are instances of classes, which also determines their types. 



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: An object any piece of data where as a class is what holds all the data. 

  Researched answer: A class is a blueprint from which objects are created. The object is also called as an instance of a class.



6. STRETCH: What is `attr_accessor`?

  Your answer: attr_accessor is used as a way to not have to constantly write your gets. It will take your set and know that you need a get and auto create one for you.

  Researched answer: It is a built in RUBY method that automatically sets up getters and setters for instance variables.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
- PostgreSQL - is a powerful, open source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads.

- API - An application-programming interface.

- CRUD - Create, Read, Update, and Delete. Those are the four basic functions that models should be able to do, at most.

- Ruby on Rails - Ruby on Rails, or Rails, is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby under the MIT License. Rails is a model–view–controller framework, providing default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages.

- ORM - Object-relational mapping in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language.

- Active Record - active record pattern is an architectural pattern found in software that stores in-memory object data in relational databases.
